# Sterling-E-Commerce-Data
As a data scientist, I was tasked with understanding Sterling's customer data, which, in effect, helped improve business efficiency and optimized product offerings both now and in the future. Through my work on this project, I could understand customer preferences and needs, discover any patterns or trends, and deploy bar charts, line charts, and pie charts in the distribution of features visualization.
