# Sterling-E-Commerce-Data
As a data scientist, I was tasked with understanding Sterling's customer data, which, in effect, helped improve business efficiency and optimized product offerings both now and in the future. Through my work on this project, I could understand customer preferences and needs, discover any patterns or trends, and deploy bar charts, line charts, and pie charts in the distribution of features visualization.
Customer segmentation for Sterling E-Commerce was undertaken to better understand and cater to diverse customer needs. Key features created included Total Spending per Customer, Average Order Value per Customer, Total Quantity Ordered per Customer, Number of Orders per Customer, Customer Lifetime, Repeat Purchase Rate, and Days Since Last Order. K-means clustering was applied to the dataset, with the optimal number of clusters determined to be six based on the elbow plot. The quality of clustering was assessed using the silhouette score, which indicated a well-defined grouping of customers. This segmentation enables more targeted marketing strategies and personalized customer experiences.
